# XSOLVE | RECRUITMENT TASK

There are employeeâ€™s personal data in data.json file. The task is to:
* present them in a table and to implement filtering according to each attribute (it is
recommended to use any datepicker for attribute date type)
* do sorting and pagination (5 results for one page)

It is allowed to use any library, but every functionality (filtering, sorting, pagination) should be
implemented independently.

Please, share your solution as a repository on Github.

## Functionality and Usability

* you can sort the values in ascending order, by clicking the corresponding table label
* you can search data by category, by typing search term and pressing the __Enter__ button
* you can display more result, by clicking tabs
